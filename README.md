# Real Draft History

As basketball fans, we’ve all felt the same frustration. You look up your favorite team's draft history to see how the roster was built, but the data is misleading.

You see a player listed who never played a single game for your team, only to remember, "Oh, right, he was traded on draft night." Meanwhile, the player your team actually acquired in that deal is listed on another team's history, as if they were the ones who drafted him.

A perfect example is the 2018 draft. Most draft histories show the Atlanta Hawks selected Luka Dončić and the Dallas Mavericks selected Trae Young. For a fan trying to understand how those teams were built, this is backward and confusing.

We Fix That.
This website was built to solve that one, simple problem.

We do the work of tracking all the draft-night trades and transactions so you don't have to. Our histories are organized by acquisition, not just selection.

You WON'T see players a team selected for another team. You WILL see players a team traded for on draft night.

Our goal is to be the definitive resource for fans, writers, and researchers who want to know the true story of how an NBA team was constructed. No more mental notes, no more confusing spreadsheets, just the actual draft history.
